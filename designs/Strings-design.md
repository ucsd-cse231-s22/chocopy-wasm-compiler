# Compiler A: Strings
## 10 test cases

1. Store a string as a variable.
    ```Python
    s:str = "abcd"
    print(s)
    s
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    abcd
    "abcd"
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    We are considering that using a series of ASCIIs to store string in the momeory. However, in ir.ts, type VarInit\<A> = { a?: A, name: string, type: Type, value: Value\<A> }, the value is of type Value\<A>. Thus, for now we cannot simply assign the string to the variable (s here) because we need to allocate a block of memory and store the ASCIIs (this should be done in Expr\<A>).
    
    We have some solutions about this issue:
    1. When initializing a string variable (s:str = "abcd"), in parser.ts, we first parse it to s:str = None, then s = "abcd", i.e. we spilt varInit into varInit and Stmt(assignStmt). However, in class, we just have varInits and methods, thus, we cannot modify the string initialization in this way.
    2. We are thinking about changing the IR.VarInit\<A> = { a?: A, name: string, type: Type, value: Value\<A> } to IR.VarInit\<A> = { a?: A, name: string, type: Type, value: Expr\<A> }. By this way, we can accomplish the allocation and storing jobs.
    3. Actually, we are thinking about also change the AST.VarInit\<A> = { a?: A, name: string, type: Type, value: Literal } to AST.VarInit\<A> = { a?: A, name: string, type: Type, value: Expr\<A> }. We know that in ChocoPy, when initialzing the variables, we should not use a expression at the right hand side. Thus, when initialzing the variables which need the memory, the right hand side can only be None. However, by modifying the VarInit stucture, we can support the initializations such as l: [int] = [1, 2, 3] and c: C = C() where C is a class object. Then our behavior will be more python-like.

    Our temporay solution is that we require the user of our compiler to defined a string in two steps, which is the same as defining a class:
    1. Assign "None" to 1. (e.g. x:str = None)
    2. Assign a value to it. (e.g. x = "abcd")
    
    Therefore, the test case 1 will be:
    ```Python
    s:str = None
    s = "abcd"
    print(s)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    abcd
    ```

2. Return the length of a string.
    ```Python
    s:str = "abcd"
    print(len(s))
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    4
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    Our solution is that when storing a string, we firstly store its length on top of its memory block (The string type should be immutable, so the length will not change). By doing so, when we want to load the string, we can know where to stop when generating the wasm loop block.

    Besides, regrading the builtin print and len, we would like to define two functions in wasm: print_str and len_str to handle the string case. For print_str, we first get the length of the string, and then generate a wasm loop to load the ASCIIs of the strings and convert them back to string. For len_str, simpler, we can get the length and call print_num (haven't implemented).

    For now, we implement the print_str in complier.ts by adding new variables to get the length of the string and handle the loop block in wasm. In the following weeks, we should implement them in lower.ts using
    the for loop designed by the fop loop group.

    ```Python
    s:str = None
    s = "abcd"
    print(len(s))
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    4
    ```

3. Concatenate two strings
    ``` Python
    s1:str = "ab"
    s2:str = "cd"
    print(s1 + s2)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    abcd
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    One main issue of the operations (concat, comparsion, indexing) on string is that we only have the information of the string starting address. If we want to realize these operations without touching the complier.ts, I think we need more information of string.

    We have some solutions as followed:
    1. Modify some structures in AST of IR by adding the string value information, but it seems problematic because it will change some basic behaviors of our complier.
    2. Adding Map\<string, string>() in the envirnment in type-check.ts and lower.ts. When we encounter a string variable, we not only set its varaible map to true, but also set its value map to its value. Because we need the value information rather than the starting address to do the operations above.

    We are not very clear about how to do this. For now, when indexing a string, we just simply place a placeholder for the output because if we want to do the operations of string, in lower.ts, we cannot get the value of string.

4. Comparison with two strings
    ```Python
    s1:str = "ab"
    s2:str = "ab"
    s3:str = "cd"
    print(s1 == s2)
    print(s1 == s3)
    print(s1 != s2)
    print(s1 != s3)
    print(s1 == "ab")
    print(s1 == "cd")
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    True
    False
    False
    True
    True
    False
    ```    


5. Indexing of a string
    ```Python
    s1:str = "abcd"
    print(s1[0])
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    a
    ```

6. Support for escape sequences ( \", \n, \t, \ )
    ```Python
    a:str = "Hello\nWorld"
    print(a)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    Hello
    World
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    We will look into the escape sequences next week.


7. Throw Error on invalid indexing
    ```Python
    s1:str = "ab"
    print(s1[2])
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```python
    Error: Index out of bounds
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    We will look into this one after we solve the environment issue (in 3).

8. Throw Error on single quotes
    ```Python
    s1:str = 'ab'
    print(s1)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    Parse Error: Unrecognized token
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    Actually, we think that we should accept the single quotes. Because in Python, there is no difference between single quotes and doulbe quotes. We are not sure why ChocoPy does not support double quotes.


9.  Throw Type Error on string plus int
    ```Python
    s1:str = 'ab'
    print(s1 + 3)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    Type Error: Cannot apply + on str and int
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    s1:str = 'ab'
    print(s1 + 3)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```Python
    Error: TYPE ERROR: Type mismatch for numeric op0
    ```

10. Throw Error on invalid(undefined) escape sequences
    ```Python
    a:str = "abcd\k"
    print(a)
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    Parse Error: Bad escape sequences
    ```

    **Update Week 7**:

    We will look into the escape sequences next week.

## Changes on AST, IR and builtin libraries
### AST
- We need to add a new Type "string" on the ast. It should be "{tag: "string"}".
- We need to add a new Literal "string". It should be "{a?:A, tag: "string", value: string}", where a is the annotation for type checking, the value is the string itself. For example, the string "abc"'s literal value is "abc".
- We need to add a new expression for indexing "{a?: A, tag: "indexing", name: Expr\<A>, index: Expr\<A>}". For example, if we enter "s[0]", the name will be an id expression on the "s" case, the index will be 0. The reason that we need the "index" to be an expression is that we also allow the script like "s[0+1]" to be acceptable.


### IR
- We need to add a new Value type which is like "{ tag: "string"; value: string; address: number }". The value is the string itself as in ast. The address is where the start of the addresss where the string is stored.
- ISSUE:

### Builtin libraries
- len(): The length of a string can just be outputed by the length of the "value". Other data types like list and dictionary will also use the same len() function. So, there might be some changes on it.

## New functions, datatypes, and/or files

There will be no completely "new" and "independent" functions that will be added to the codebase. However, I would like to discuss some new codes and modifications that will be added to the current codebase.

- Parser
    - New case "String" on the traverseType
    - New case "String" on the traverseLiteral
    - New case "len" on the traverseExpr for CallExpression
    - New condition for MemberExpression on traverseExpr when we are traversing the indexing
    - **Update Week 7**: New special case in traverseExpr -> "MemberExpression": add the index case.

- Type Checker
    - New case "string" on typeCheckLiteral. Specifically, we need to check whether the escape sequences are valid.
    - New case "indexing" on typeCheckExpr. Specifically, we need to check whether the expression that we perform indexing on is type "string".
    - New case for typeCheckExpr - case "binexpr". For example, "abc" + 3 should throw a TYPE ERROR.
    - **Update Week 7**: New temporal modification on function isSubtype(): Add an OR case "t1.tag == "none".
    - **Update Week 7**: New temporal case tcExpr -> "index": add annotation to index expression.

- **Update Week 7**: Lower
    - New special case in flattenExprToExpr -> "Literal": Add operations on string (allocation and store)
    - New temporal case flattenExprToExpr -> "Index": Handle the string indexing.

- Compiler 
    - New case "string" for codeGenLiteral, according to the length of the string we need to use the $heap pointer to allocate some space for the string
    - New case "len" on the codeGenExpr for the builtin functions
    - New case "Indexing" on the codeGenExpr for the indexing operations
    - Modifications on the codeGenExpr when we applying concatenation of strings
    - **Update Week 7**: New case "print_str" on the codeGenExpr case "builtin1". To print the whole string, we fetch the length of the string from the first place of the address. Then, we use loop to get the ASCII in turn and call the print_str function

- **Update Week 7**: webstart.ts
    - Modification on the print function. If coming across str type, we use tag:nobr instead of tag:pre to avoid the character getting into a new line.
    - Also, at the beginning of reading a string, we call print_enter function to switch to the next line and then print the character in order.

- **Update Week 7**: string.test
        We write several tests to make sure our implementation of String features is correct. You can refer to /tests/string.test.ts for details. Generally, they include
    - Type-checking for string, string concatenation, string indexing
    - Print tests for string, string concatenation, string indexing, string comparison. They are tested in body statement, in functions or as a argument of a function, and in class.


    
## A description of the value representation and memory layout for any new runtime

We would like to store the value of the string by (Extended)ASCII. Since ASCII is from 0 to 256, we would like to store a i32 to represent each character of a string into a continuous memory space and the start address of the string will be returned. Also, we will store the length of the string in the start address. In this way, when we reading a variable of string type, we can know where to stop (maybe useful for indexing).


## **Update Week 7**: Conclusion

The most changllenging part of string is that string lies in the level of AST.Literal and IR.Value but it behaves in the level of AST.Expr and IR.Expr because we need the allocate the memory block and store its ASCIIs.

For now, we cannot do operations on string if we don't refractor some sturtures. Any other features like len(), string concatenation, string indexing and string comparison is just a combination of them. As for the store part, we managed to store a string into the memory heap. But we add some restrictions on it (Assigning None to a string first). The hard part is that we cannot make modification on the CodeGen, and the expressions and statements that IR offered are limited which will make it significantly complicated to generate the right WASM code by compiler.ts.


#Update Week 8:

In this week, we nearly fix all the leftover of week 7. 
1. Now we can directly define a string like a:str = "abcd" in body, functions and classses.
2. Index, concatenation and comparison for strings are implemented.
3. We change and encapsulate the code when we want to print a string. Now, it is not hard-coded in compiler.ts.
4. We add supports for escape sequences: \\", \\\\, \n and \t.
5. All tests are written inside function or class in string.test.ts.

New feature:
1. We might add string slicing like **a = "abcd"[0:2]**.
2. Supports for more escape sequences.
3. Add string duplication like **s = "a" * 3**.
