## Updated Tests
### 1. Classes inherited from `object`

**Case:**
```
class Rat(object):
        id: int = 123
        y: int = 0
        def __init__(self: Rat):
            self.y = 1

    x: Rat = None
    x = Rat()
```
**Expected:**
Let `o` be the object referred to by variable `x`
```
assert number of references of o is 1
assert size of o(in bytes) is 4
assert type of the fields in o is [value]
```

            self.y = 1
    x: Rat = None
    y: Rat = None
    x = Rat()

## Updated Changes to IR

We managed to do our implementation without making any changes to IR.

## Added functions/ data types/ files
Functions for reference counting are added to `memory.ts`. We do plan to eventually port things to WASM once we have most functionality for the GC in place and are able to support BigInt and Lists without issues, and have more extensive tests.

## Updated Value representation and memory layout

![Memory layout with metadata](./images/metadata.drawio.png)

The type of a field is denoted by a single bit. For the memory manager we feel that it does not really matter what the type of an field is, as long as we are able to differentiate between data and references to data. The current representation that we plan uses 32 bits to represent types in an object, which puts an upper bound on the number of fields in an object to 32. If needed this number can be easily increased, assigning more bits to storing types in the metadata.

The size of the object is stored in bytes, and the number of references is stored along with the object.

Update: We added an `amount` field to denote the total amount of memory allocated in bytes. `size` field holds the size of a single object in the data stored. The total number of objects associated would then be `(amount - metadatsize) / size`.

### Compaction/ Defragmentation
Performing defragmentation for the heap will move objects around in the heap. Since, we can't go about modifying all the references, each object we create will have an **immutable reference number**. We plan to maintain a mapping from this reference number to the actual location in memory. When compaction takes place we will update this mapping. All variables in the program will store the **reference number** instead of the actual address in memory.

## Updates and Design decisions (Week 2) 

We were able to pass all the tests which we had described last week. The node traversal and the scoping were the most intereresting this week and `Tests 9`, `Test 10`, `Test 4` and `Test 5` are a good representation of the cases we have accounted for. Our tests are present in the `memory.test.ts` file. We had to add a function to `asserts.test.ts` to support testing for memory management functions.

Originally we has planned to do the bulk of our changes at the IR level but we ended up implementing code to add metadata by constructing IR objects. We found that doing so reduced the compexity of our implementation.

We had to make some changes in `compiler.ts` to support some of the memory management functionality. However, this does not break the originial implementation in any way. 

We abstracted out the functionality for memory management in `memory.ts`.

We were a bit unclear at the start of Week 1 as to how we would differentiate between references and values, this part is implemented in `lower.ts`.

We also added another field to denote the total amount of data allocated in bytes, since without this we would not have been able to know how many objects we stored in a contiguous fashion at a given memory location. This allows the array list group to request any amount of data. Note that the `Data` field in the memory metadata diagram denotes the maximum memory which can be allocated by one object. We can however allocate any amount of such objects in a contiguous manner.

We had a bit of a trouble in figuring out how to check if the reference counts that we collect are indeed correct since we don't have access to the variable names. For testing we added a field called `id` to each object which stores a unique identifier for an object. The reference counts and other metadata was tested using this field as an identifier.
